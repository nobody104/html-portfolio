<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 31-year old Swedish guy living with my Japanese wife in Tokyo.<br>
  I have recently started getting into web development and learning how to code with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also dabble with Python a bit, and I am loving it so far.
</p>

<p>Other than my newly aquired interest for programming, I really enjoy Philosophy, Psychology and also Music,Movies/Books/Stories that deeply explore these topics. </p>

<p>I really see myself working with a unknown combination of this in the future, but hopefully within web development, depending on how the AI situation pans out in the next coming years I suppose.</p>
